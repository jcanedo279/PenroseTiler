# PenroseTiler
A Penrose Tile collection built by the hyper grid method, optimized by a genetic algorithm


### VERY IMPORTANT###
### IN ORDER TO RUN: geneticTiler.py###
In order to run the geneticTiler.py script, place the repository into a folder (preferably on your Desktop). Then create a folder named "Pop_Tree_Figs" (mind the capital letters and underscores), and run the geneticTiler.py script from within the folder this script is in. Chose your parameters accordingly and watch the algorithm find a trivial solution if one exists for your instance of the tiling algorithm.
